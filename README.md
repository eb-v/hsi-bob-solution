What our application does:

The app allows for clients/businesses to create a profile which allows our AI solution to personalize towards them better since the model gains context towards the client/business. It also allows for the client to upload any image or flyer that's an advertisement and refine it into a much more personalized and better advertisement. There is also a customer retention page which essentially a dashboard with important KPIs and interactive visuals that have to do with keeping our customers. Lastly, there is a sustainability page which compares how much our carbon emissions increase/decrease based on how much money we're making from our advertisements and gives a visual analysis for it as well.

What tech/frameworks does it use:

We used Node.js for our execution and Next.js as our framework. In terms of actually technology, all code was developed through the IDE VS code and pushed online to a repository through Github and deployed on Vercer. Some other things to note are that we did use a lucide package.

What the judge should do to navigate/interpret our application:

The judge should first sign in with any viable working email and any password of their choosing. Then from there, they will be brought to a home page with a side bar with multiple tabs. The judge can then go through and click through the tabs and interact with whatever is on each page. The sidebar will be visible on all pages accessed so the judge can go back to the home page whenever. I would suggest going to the Onboarding and Data Foundation page first, the Retention and Customer Marketing page second, and the Sustainability and Cost Efficiency page last.
